I have been in Tech long enough to know that — some things endure the test of time, become ubiquitous, and become household names.
While other things are passing fads.

Which one is the Fediverse.
Will it endure‽
Is it a passing fad‽
Do we get a say‽

I am reminded of a quotation from a movie:

“The future is not set. There is no fate, but what we make for ourselves.”

I do think we get say.
I think there are things we can do to make the Fediverse endure.
The Fediverse //is// what we make it.

Here is one of those things we can do —

For the Fediverse to endure, for it to not be a passing fad, it needs payments built into it.
Here the first reason //why//.

❦

Is the Fediverse for //everyone//‽

I typed those words into the Mastodon mobile-phone app (into Tusky), and tapped the “post” button.
I had created a poll asking people to vote — “yes” or “no”.
Do you think the Fediverse is for everyone, or not‽

In less than a second, my poll was cast into the vast expanses of the Fediverse.
Within an instance, thousands of people recevied it.
Some even re-cast my poll themselves, causing it to reach thousands more.

Over the next 3 days, people voted.

I checked on the poll multiple times a day.
I didn't know which way the poll would go.
Would more people vote, “yes”‽
Would more people vote, “no”‽

To be frank, I hoped that more people would vote, “yes”.
But I was worried that most people didn't feel that way.

There is a reason I am involved with the Fediverse — and am focused on decentralized social-media networks.
Said simply — I think the Internet is broken, I think the Web is broken, and I think social-media is broken.
And I don't think I am the only one who feels this way.
I think decentralized social-media networks — such as the Fediverse — are a means to an end.
I think they can help make the world a little //less worse// — and maybe even a little //better//

Our lives are finite.
I think about the world my children are growing up in, and will inherit.
I want to try to make it a better place.
There are obviously limits to what any of us, as individuals, can do — but we can do //some// things each of us can do.

After 3 days, my poll had closed.
The winner was, “yes”! 🙂 — yes, the Fediverse was for everyone!
I was glad.
In fact, not only did more people vote “yes”, but — //the vast majority// of people voted “yes”!
I always felt that the Fediverse should be for everyone.
I was glad the vast majority of people agreed with me.
It will make my efforts to try to make things //better// easier.

So, how do we get everyone here onto the Fediverse‽

§§ John Does & Jane Does

I grew up hearing my father mentioning the name “Joe Blow” from time to time.
“Joe Blow” was a common //placeholder name// he grew up with.
It was often used to denote the //common man//.

For example — “The Joe Blow's of the world love this.”

“//John Doe//“ and “//Jane Doe//“ were the common //placeholder names// I grew up with — which were also used to denote the //common man// and //common woman//.
I.e., normal typical people.

If the Fediverse is for everyone, and we want to get everyone here (onto the Fediverse), then — //everyone// includes all the //John Doe//s and //Jane Joe//s out there.

So, how do we get them onto the Fediverse‽

The answer is //involved//, but to me it is obvious the answer includes something — **payments**.
We need //payments// on the Fediverse .
And really, we need //decentralized// payments.

But that answer is only obvious when you are aware of the history of computers, of computer-networks, and how people have been using them over the last 30 to 50 years.
So let's talk about that history, because it is important.

§§ The Web

**The Fediverse today reminds me of the Web in the 1990s.**

It was uncharted territory.
It was unexplored, and full of endless possibilities.
It was a digital frontier where anything seemed possible.
It was a time of discovery and digital revolution & evolution.
It (the Web) was a much different place than it is today.

First — it was called the //the world wide web//, and not just //the web//.
That is where the “www” in Internet domains such as “www.example.com” comes from — “www” is short for “//world wide web//“.

Second — it was inhabited by computer hobbyists, technologists, enthusiasts, and other pioneering early adopters of computer technology.
Today, in many parts of the world, most people have computers — in fact, many have multiple computers.
Back then, most households either had zero or one computer — and most had zero.
Having a computer back then was not //yet// common — and if you had a computer, you were //unusual// (in a good way) — you were (as you probably guessed it) likely at least a //computer enthusiast//, maybe a //computer technologist// or some kind, or a //computer hobbyist//, or some other type of early adopter of computer technology.
But having access to a computer was a prerequisite for viewing the Web — and thus, these are the people who created and consumed the Web of the 1990s.

Internet speeds were much much slower back then.
Downloading (what, by today's standards, would be considered) a lower-resolution photo (as a .JPEG) could take 30 minutes or more!

You were tethered to a desk when you wanted to view the the Web.
The type of computers most people had back then were //not// portable — they were large heavy machines.
No smart-phones.
No tablets.
No laptops.
Your computer (or computer-terminal) was on a desk — you went to the computer, you didn't take the computer with you.

You //surfed// the Web back then — you didn't //search// it.
You started on one web-page, clicked a hyper-link that took you to another web-page, spent some time there, clicked another hyper-link that took you to another web-page, and repeated that over and over again.
Also, web-browser //tabs// didn't exist yet — this experiece different.

§§ The Internet

And back then, the Web hadn't //yet// absorbed the rest of the Internet yet — and become the ubiquitous user-interface for almost everything yet.
Back in the 1990s, the Web was one of the things you did on the Internet — but it wasn't the only thing.

We had Usenet and e-mail mailing-lists — the precursor to Reddit, Lemmy, and Kbin.

We had the finger-protocol — the precursor social-networking.

We even had the gopher-protocol — which is sort of like the Web, but lacked the //rich-text// and //image support// that later versions of the Web included.

We also had FTP, IRC, telnet, and others interesting application protocols.

§§ Before The Internet

There is a history of the Internet that I have heard told over and over again that more or less claims that before the Internet there was the ARPANET — end of story.

This is a lie — or, at least, extremely misleading.

Before the (mainstream) Internet there was BBS.

Many of the early Internet application protocols were copies of things that already existed on BBS — netmail, echomail, file downloads, etc.

§§ Dot-Com Boom

Something happened in the 1990s and early 2000s — the Web //boomed//!

§§ What If

Would the Web still exist if the dot-com boom didn't happen‽

//What-If//s like this are difficult to answer, but —

I don't think the answer (to this question) is a //definitive ‘yes’//
I think the answer (to this question) could conceivably have been a //‘no’//.

It is probably difficult to imagine how small the Web was back in the 1990s.
Compared to the Web of today — it was very very tiny.

The Web back then in the 1990s, wasn't ubiquitous yet, wasn't a household word yet, hadn't become part of mass-culture yet, hadn't become a part of everyday-life yet.

I suspect that if the //dom-com boom// hadn't happened, and //normal people// hadn't started using the Web en masse — I suspect the Web might not still be around.

I will give you an example — meet-ups.

I started going to meet-ups in the year 2012 or 2013.
The meet-ups I went to were like little conferences — and I enjoyed conferences.
In the beginning, I was going to something like 4 to 8 meet-ups per week — and sometimes going to more than one meet-up per day.

Eventually I started organizing meet-ups.
In fact, I organized meet-ups for about a decade.
I organized a number of different meet-ups.
I also had friend who organized their own meet-ups.

Here is something I noticed — popular meet-ups have communities develop around them.

Here is something else I noticed — if an organizer doesn't make a deliberate effort to bring in new people, their community will often die.
And, as a result, their meet-up will also often die.

As I said, I organized a number of different meet-ups.
The most successful of these meet-ups were a set of AI meet-ups that I founded.
While I was involved, it was the largest AI community in western Canada.
(I stopped organizing them after my wife became pregnant with our first child.)
We would fill rooms to capacity — with 200 to 300 people, or whatever the location was able to hold, there for the AI meet-up.
And with more people on the waiting-list hoping to get in.

I have a friend who is professors.
While he lived in western Canada (near me) he encouraged his students to join the meet-up.
Other professors did the same.
We had a lot of students that joined the meet-up.

Our AI community ranged in age from teenagers to people in their 70s.
And we had a regular in-flow of new people joining the meet-up and the broader community.

I had other friends who did //not// do this.
Two friends of mine founded and organized a meet-up that was, at one point, more popular than mine.
It was one of the most popular meet-ups in the world.
But now, more than a decade later, it is dead.

Here is what happened.
Their meet-up had a very large community around it.
But it didn't bring in new people — it didn't bring in younger people.
Although we were all young when that community started — I remember at one point, that the youngest person at one the meet-up was in their late 30s.

Things tend to happen as people get older.
They get busy with work.
They boy-friends or girl-friends.
They get married.
They have children.
They get other interests.
They loose interest.

Slowly over time these people leave (as active members of) the community.
Even people who were ‘regulars’ — coming to all the meet-ups for years — eventually leave (as active members of) the community.

I suspect that this could have been the fate of the Web if the //dom-com boom// hadn't happened, and //normal people// hadn't started using the Web en masse.
The Web might have died.
The Web might have been forgotten.

######

§§ Influencers

What do normal people want‽
What attracts them to a social-media platform‽
#####

(Some of you aren't going to like this answer, but I think it is accurate nonetheless —)

A lot, probably most, normal people want //influencers// — they want the celebrities, the key-opinion-leaders (KOL), ####.

A lot of these //influencers// are making a living from being an //influencers//.
It isn't just a hobby for them.
Being an //influencers// is a job for them.

If they cannot make money from being an //influencers// then they don't eat, then they cannot pay their rent, etc.

§§ No Ads

I have heard people claim that most people on the Fediverse are against advertisements.
That isn't accurate.
A lot of the current Fediverse culture is allergic to //non-consensual// advertisements.
The ‘non-consensual’ part is the important.
These are sometimes also called //obtrusive ads//.

Many people on the Fediverse follow the Fediverse accounts of companies that they are fan of.
Those companies post about their products on the Fediverse accounts.
Those are ads.
They aren't //obtrusive ads// — the people who follow those company Fediverse accounts consent to seeing those posts.
But they are ads.

Havingt said that, the type of //obtrusive ads// that exist on other platforms aren't on the Fediverse.

And that means an influencer cannot (indirectly) derive their income from //obtrusive ads// on the Fediverse.

So if we don't have the funds from //obtrusive ads// — what income options do (potential) influencers on the Fediverse have‽
Payments.

§§ Payment

 



§§ Conclusion

For the Fediverse to survive you need //normal people/ to join it.

For //normal people// to join the Fediverse en masse you need //influencers// on the Fediverse.

To make the Fediverse attractive for most //influencers// to join the Fediverse and stay on it they need to be able to make living on it.

To make it so the Fediverse can make a living on the Fediverse, you need payments to be part of the Fediverse.
